    I'm trying to implement a function that outputs the "main screen" of the application.
    This output is supposed to ask the user if they would like to deposit, withdraw, or exit app.
    POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
    - Maybe run a do while that always ask the user at the beginning what they want to do. Then when they finally
    - hit the exit button then terminate the program
