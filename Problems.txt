    I'm trying to implement a function that outputs the "main screen" of the application.
    This output is supposed to ask the user if they would like to deposit, withdraw, or exit app.
    POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
    - Maybe run a do while that always ask the user at the beginning what they want to do. Then when they finally
    - hit the exit button then terminate the program
FIXED:implemented solutions.

    Ran into a problem where account balance isn't printing out properly.
    POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
    -look at print summary function for transaction type class.
FIXED: Had to ignore ending total, and end up not using it because to resolve ambiguity . So to print account summary at a certain state
just subtract withdraw amount from deposit amount.
