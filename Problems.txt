    I'm trying to implement a function that outputs the "main screen" of the application.
    This output is supposed to ask the user if they would like to deposit, withdraw, or exit app.
    POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
    - Maybe run a do while that always ask the user at the beginning what they want to do. Then when they finally
    - hit the exit button then terminate the program
FIXED:implemented solutions.

    Ran into a problem where account balance isn't printing out properly.
    POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
    -look at print summary function for transaction type class.
FIXED: Had to ignore ending total, and end up not using it because to resolve ambiguity . So to print account summary at a certain state
just subtract withdraw amount from deposit amount.

    Ran into bug where where application was reading in the first line as the bank balance, so stod exception was being thrown out.
FIXED: Had to step through using debugger to figure out on what line stod exception was being thrown.
